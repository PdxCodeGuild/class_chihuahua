# Roles & Responsibilities

## Minimum Criteria to Graduate

- all lab solutions- organized, tested, commented
- a capstone which demonstrates proficiency in each of the five areas we cover
- not absent more than 10% of the class days

## Attendance & Attention

We try to make room for people's personal lives. We're all adults, it's up to your judgement whether a reason for missing class is justified. However, if you're not present, you won't be engaged and won't be learning. You can quickly fall behind if you miss several classes in succession. The course moves fast, and each topic builds upon the last.

Students can miss 10% of the days at most (7 for the 14-week class, 8 for the 16-week class). The only exceptions are up to five days of excused absence already arranged before the course starts. You can make up classes by coming in additional hours outside of class. You can also make up absences by completing the assignments on your own, and reviewing those solutions with me.

All participants should arrive on time. The start of the class is the easiest time to make announcements and give lectures because everyone's synchronized. If you arrive late, I have to remember what I said before you came in and make sure to tell you it, and inevitably something gets lost in the shuffle. It's also disruptive, and waiting for late people punishes people who came on time. **Arriving more than 15 minutes late 3 times counts as an absence.**

All participants should remain focused on their work while here, or at least not distract others. Let's maximize the return on the time we're all investing.


## Responsibilities

Below are more specific responsibilities that pertain to each of our roles. We don't have to stick very strictly to these roles or make absolutely sure we're doing 100% of these things 100% of the time. They exist as points of reference, to create a class dynamic that's conducive to learning.

## Code of Conduct

At PDX Code Guild we seek to create an environment conducive to personal and professional growth. Academic and personal integrity are central to creating such an environment.

- Respect the rights of all others. Foster a safe and comfortable social environment. Show respect for every member of our community, including members of partnering communities without regard to sex, age, race, color, ethnic origins, sexual orientation, economic status, gender expression, size, physical ability, learning styles, nationality, religion, or thought.
- Treat one another in a professional manner at all times. Harassment, intimidation, humiliation, excluding or acts of bullying will not be tolerated. If you witness such acts, report them immediately to a school official.
- Refrain from disruptive behavior in the classroom, on the PDX Code Guild premises, and at any PDX Code Guild hosted event.
- Engage in conduct appropriate for an educational and professional setting, refraining from behavior that may shock or disturb others.
- Refrain from recreational drug use. Refrain from use of alcohol except in moderation at events hosted at the PDX Code Guild premises outside of class time that serve alcohol.
- No smoking, vaping or use of tobacco products on the PDX Code Guild premises except for designated areas outside. Please dispose of cigarette butts and other tobacco products in the dumpster outside.
- Refrain from using offensive or abusive language.
- Be honest and trustworthy.
- Keep the spaces you use nice for the next person. Clean and wipe up your desk area (and the floor around your desk). Remove dishes, food wrappers and crumbs. Clean up after yourself in all common areas. Wash any dishes you use.

## Academic Honesty

Do not look at the solution or other students' solutions until you've finished the lab yourself. Do not copy other student's code. Do not copy code off the internet unless it's a small amount and you know exactly what it means. Do not try and complete a lab by googling a tutorial. You're only inhibiting your own learning by doing so. Cheating is also a violation of our code of conduct and can result in expulsion.

You are encouraged to use resources (docs, online, books, each other) to research solutions. If you copy code from the internet or a book, you must understand what it means and how it works. If you're not sure, look up the function in the docs, try running it with a variety of inputs, and try tweaking the syntax, throw in print statements to print the values of variables at different times, etc. You also cannot use a single function which performs the entirety of the solution for you. The early labs are designed to practice string and list operations, using a function that does it all defeats the purpose.

## Attendance

Students are expected to be on time and attend all scheduled class times. The school requires ninety percent (90%) completion of class hours in order to receive a certificate of completion from the course. Students can miss no more than 7 days for the day class and 9 days for the evening class. Students can also not be absent for more than 5 days consecutively (this includes weekends).

Any Student arriving more than 15 minutes late for scheduled class time will be marked tardy. Tardiness without legitimate reason on three different occasions will be counted as one absence.
