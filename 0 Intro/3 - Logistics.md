## Contact

You are welcome to email me at any time: [alex@pdxcodeguild.com](mailto:alex@pdxcodeguild.com). We will also have a channel on the [PDX Code Guild Slack](https://portlandcodeguild.slack.com/).

## Zoom

We will be using Zoom for holding class. This is the closest we can get to an in person classroom with lectures, whiteboards, breakouts, etc. You will be given the link for our daily Zoom meetings that make up class.

## Slack

Slack is a chat application. THis is how I will send out quick updates and how you can ask other students and instructors questions. Keep in mind Slack is ephemeral, and messages will disappear after about two weeks.
