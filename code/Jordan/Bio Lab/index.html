        A corgi is described by the American Kennel Club (AKC) is " is a strong, athletic, and lively little herder who
        is affectionate and companionable without being needy.
        They are one the world's most popular herding breeds. At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a
        well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package.
        Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day's work. Built long and low,
        Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile.
        They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings. The Pembroke is a bright,
        sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training.
        As herders bred to move cattle, they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute
        senses and a 'big dog' bark.
        Families who can meet their bold but kindly Pembroke's need for activity and togetherness will never have a more
        loyal, loving pet."
