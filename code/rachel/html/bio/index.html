        <h4>What’s so
            special
            about Oregon
            White Oaks?</h4>
        <p>The Oregon white oak (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_garryana">Quercus
            garryana</a>) is an attractive deciduous
            hardwood tree native to Oregon, found
            as far north as British Columbia and as
            far south as southern California. These
            lovely hardwoods seem able to withstand
            both lengthy flooding and drought, and
            are most common on sites that are either
            too exposed or too dry for other tree
            species.</p>
            <p>During the 1800’s oak savanna was a
            common sight in the Willamette Valley.
            Mature oaks provided an abundance
            of food for the Kalapuya Indians, who
            used the tree’s acorns to make acorn
            meal. Its large acorns mature in one
            season, ripening from late August to
            November.</p>
            <img src="images/Quercus_garryanna_xera.jpg" alt="Oregon White Oak in a field">
            <p>Although it can reproduce in its own
            shade, Oregon white oak will die after
            overtopping by Douglas-fir. Oregon’s
            periodic summer wildfires and the
            burning practices of the Kalapuya created
            white oaks that were mostly open-grown,
            individual trees. However, with the arrival
            of European settlers and the suppression
            of most naturally occurring fires, conifers
            (evergreen trees) like Douglas-fir began
            to naturally encroach upon the oaks.</p>
            <p>It’s now estimated that more than 99
            percent of pre-settlement prairies and
            savannas in Oregon have been converted
            to urban areas, farms, and other
            developments. In addition
            to urban development, yet
            another challenge to this native
            tree is the spread of invasive plant species.
            In order to germinate, its seeds need to
            be kept moist in soil or under leaf litter.
            Unfortunately, invasive, non-native
            plants like Scotch broom and Himalayan
            blackberry reduce the survival and
            growth rate of oak seedlings.</p>
           <h4>What’s in a name?</h4>
            <p>The Oregon white oak’s scientific
            name, Quercus garryana, was chosen to
            honor Nicholas Garry, who served as
            deputy governor and as a board member
            of the Hudson Bay Company. In the early
            1800’s the Hudson Bay Company served
            as a center of the fur trade in the vicinity
            of Winnipeg, Man. Canada. Garry was
            known for his tactful and diplomatic
            fur trade dealings with both whites and
            Natives alike. </p>
            <p>Oregon white oak can also sprout from
            cut stumps and root collars, and their
            roots also go deeper than many other tree
            types. A deep taproot and well-developed
            lateral roots serve to make them very wind
            firm, even in wet areas.</p>
            <p>In the wood products industry,
            Oregon white oak’s strong, hard, and
            attractive wood is sometimes used for
            flooring and other wood products. It has
            also been used for furniture, chairs, and
            wine barrels, and is also frequently used
            for firewood.
            <h4>Worth the wait</h4>
            <p>Generally speaking, Oregon white
            oaks grow slowly in both height and
            diameter. Unfortunately, park managers
            and homeowners don’t plant Oregon
            white oak for landscaping because of
            its reputation as a slow grower. That’s
            a shame, as this tree really has a lot to
            offer.</p>
            <h4>Valuable real estate?</h4>
            <p>Ask birds, wildlife.
            An important aspect about all native
            plants and trees in general is their ability
            to provide much-needed habitat for
            wildlife. Diversity of bird species is often
            higher in oak forests than in adjacent
            conifer forests. Oregon white oaks
            provide favorable habitat to a number
            of important wildlife types, including
            the western gray squirrel, which is
            listed as threatened in Washington and
            sensitive in Oregon - and to many birds,
            including dark-eyed juncos, goldfinches,
            nuthatches, wild turkeys, and acorn and
            pileated woodpeckers.</p>
            <p>Enjoy, appreciate, grow and cultivate
            these important Oregon natives at every
            opportunity.</p>
