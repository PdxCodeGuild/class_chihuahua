            <p> The Oregon white oak, <i>(Quercus garryanna)</i>, is a majestic tree that has been growing west of the Cascades from British Columbia to southern California for thousands of years. It's misleading to say that it was first "discovered" and "named" by David Douglas in the 1820's as it had been an important plant for native peoples of the region for centuries prior.</p>
