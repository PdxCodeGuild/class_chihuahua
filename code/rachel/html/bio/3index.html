                    <q><strong>The chief beauty of the Oregon white oak</strong> is in the light hue of the bark, almost bone-white sometimes. The great trunks, of a winter twilight, when the leaves are fallen, may stand out almost like cemetery slabs, with a strangely ghostly effect, but by day their pale bark has a look of cool elegance. Sometimes, where the fog or rainfall is heavy, the trunks and boughs are rimed with emerald moss which flows every twist of the gnarled branches till they look like something out of a Grimm fairy tale.</q>

                        <li><strong>1815 N Humboldt</strong> - 80' height x 109' spread, 21.3' circumference (This one is    perhaps the oldest in the city!)</li>
                        <li><strong>9107 N Richmond Ave</strong> - 110' height x 95' spread, 16.5' circumference</li>
                        <li><strong>4620 SW 28th Pl</strong> - 95' height x 105' spread, 16.9' circumference</li>
                        <li><strong>Willamette Park, 7100 SW Macadam Ave</strong> - 102' height x 72' spread, 17' circumference  </li>
                        <li><strong>SW Patton & Old Orchard Rd</strong> - 87' height x 100' spread, 17.8' circumference</li>

                <h4>What’s so special about Oregon White Oaks?</h4>
                <p>The Oregon white oak (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_garryana">Quercus
                garryana</a>) is an attractive deciduous hardwood tree native to Oregon, found as far north as British Columbia and as far south as southern California. These
                lovely hardwoods seem able to withstand both lengthy flooding and drought, and
                are most common on sites that are either too exposed or too dry for other tree
                species.</p>
                <p>During the 1800’s oak savanna was a common sight in the Willamette Valley.
                Mature oaks provided an abundance of food for the Kalapuya Indians, who used the tree’s acorns to make acornmeal. Its large acorns mature in one season, ripening from late August to November.
                Although it can reproduce in its own shade, Oregon white oak will die after
                overtopping by Douglas-fir. Oregon’s periodic summer wildfires and the
                burning practices of the Kalapuya created white oaks that were mostly open-grown,
                individual trees. However, with the arrival of European settlers and the suppression
                of most naturally occurring fires, conifers (evergreen trees) like Douglas-fir began
                to naturally encroach upon the oaks.</p>
                <p>It’s now estimated that more than 99 percent of pre-settlement prairies and
                savannas in Oregon have been converte to urban areas, farms, and other
                developments. In addition to urban development, yet another challenge to this native
                tree is the spread of invasive plant species. In order to germinate, its seeds need to         be kept moist in soil or under leaf litter. Unfortunately, invasive, non-native
                plants like Scotch broom and Himalayan blackberry reduce the survival and
                growth rate of oak seedlings.</p>
            
                <h4>What’s in a name?</h4>
                <p>The Oregon white oak’s scientific name, Quercus garryana, was chosen to
                honor Nicholas Garry, who served as deputy governor and as a board member
                of the Hudson Bay Company. In the early 1800’s the Hudson Bay Company served
                as a center of the fur trade in the vicinity of Winnipeg, Man. Canada. Garry was
                known for his tactful and diplomatic fur trade dealings with both whites and
                Natives alike.</p> 
                <p>Oregon white oak can also sprout from cut stumps and root collars, and their
                roots also go deeper than many other tree types. A deep taproot and well-developed
                lateral roots serve to make them very wind firm, even in wet areas.</p>
                <p>In the wood products industry, Oregon white oak’s strong, hard, and attractive wood is sometimes used for flooring and other wood products. It has also been used for furniture, chairs, and wine barrels, and is also frequently used for firewood.</p>
            
                <h4>Worth the wait</h4>
                <p>Generally speaking, Oregon white oaks grow slowly in both height and
                diameter. Unfortunately, park managers and homeowners don’t plant Oregon
                white oak for landscaping because of its reputation as a slow grower. That’s a shame, as this tree really has a lot to offer.</p>
        
                <h4>Valuable real estate?</h4>
                <p>Ask birds, wildlife. An important aspect about all native
                plants and trees in general is their ability to provide much-needed habitat for
                wildlife. Diversity of bird species is often higher in oak forests than in adjacent
                conifer forests. Oregon white oaks provide favorable habitat to a number                of important wildlife types, including the western gray squirrel, which is
                listed as threatened in Washington and sensitive in Oregon - and to many birds,
                including dark-eyed juncos, goldfinches, nuthatches, wild turkeys, and acorn and
                pileated woodpeckers.</p>                
                <p class="enjoy">Enjoy, appreciate, grow and cultivate
                these important Oregon natives at every
                opportunity!</p>
