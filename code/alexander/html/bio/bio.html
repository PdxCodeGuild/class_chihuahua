Elon was born in 1971 in pretoria, south africa. In school he ws bullied alot and was even beaten so hard he was sent to the hospital and almost died. He was smart from the very beginning and when he was twelve years old he built a video game called Blastar and sold it. When he was 17 he moved to Canada and amongst other odd jobs worked on his uncle's weed farm. He did his undergraduate degree in economics and physics from the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating he did two days at Stanford before dropping out and beginning to start his companies starting with Zip2 where him and his brother coded the first ever map online. They were basically the yellow pages online. Everyone laughed at them saying they would never replace the phonebook. In retrospect not so laughable. He started X.com and he STILL owns that domain name. x.com turned into paypal which he sold to start SpaceX and Tesla. along the way he started a few more companies notably the boring company which is a tunneling company I have a particular interest in and neural link which is a brain computer interface company. The goal of all of his companies is to make life better for humanity in the most important ways. Tesla to move mobility to electric faster than it would have otherwise. SpaceX to make civilization multiplanetary. Neuralink to make sure we are joined with computers before Artificial General Intelligence takes hold so that we may have control of our destiny. And The Boring Company, to defeat traffic, the ultimate boss battle. One thing Elon is for sure is polarizing. People love him or hate him. What do you think? let me know in the comments below.
