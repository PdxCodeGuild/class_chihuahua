# Project Overview
I am wanting to build a game, using django as my framework. The application itself will be more than a game, but will allow the user to interact their "character" in the game. The user will be able to equip gear, manage inventory, and fight AI enemies with their in-game "character".

# Functionality
I will be using django framework to have multiple routes. one page to manage the character's inventory, one page to view equipped items, and one page for the character to do the 'battle'. I will use HTML to display the pages, bootstrap to style, and python to write the functionality of the page. 

# data midel
i will have to have multiple data models for the project. 
- one data model for the character
    - what equipment can be equiped to the character
    - total strength
    - total defense
- data model for the items
    - defense and attack number
    - where it equips to character
