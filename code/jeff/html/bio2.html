    <li>Mainland Southeast Asia</li>
    <li>The Greater Sunda Islands</li>
    <li>Example 3</li>
</ul>
    
<p>Here is a quote/excerpt from their Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_broadbill">
    The banded broadbill is a striking, large-bodied bird, with a length of 
    21.5–23.0 cm (8.5–9.1 in). The weight of 10 adult pallidus specimens from
    the Malay Peninsula was 65.1–95.0 g (2.30–3.35 oz), males weighing slightly 
    more than females. If seen clearly, the species is unlikely to be confused with
    any other bird. It may be mistaken for black-and-yellow broadbill, which differs in 
    its smaller size, black head, and contrasting white collar.
