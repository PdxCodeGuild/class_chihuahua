# Write a Rectangle class in Python language, allowing you to build a rectangle with length and width attributes.
# Create a perimeter() method to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle and a area() method to calculate the area of ​​the rectangle.
# Create a method display() that display the length, width, perimeter and area of an object created using an instantiation on rectangle class.
# Create a Parallelepipede child class inheriting from the Rectangle class and with a height attribute and another volume() method to calculate the volume of the Parallelepiped.
