Name
HOME APP
Homeless Outreach Managing Engagement App

Project Overview
Major Feats: Saving inputs of names to a database with the ability to add case notes and goals/to-dos assigned for each name. These features would be useful for case managers to access their clients notes easily and get reminders on next steps and follow ups to make with client. 
Unsure of what libraries I would use at this time.

Functionality
Login page to start
Once logged in, the user would be on a homepage that displays a dashboard of impending deadlines for clients. 
On the homepage, there will be a side bar that has a search feature to search for clients. The search bar should search for first or last name. 
The side bar will also contain an option to add a new client. 
From the side bar, once the user searches for a name and selects the name from a list that populates, the user should see their information displayed. 
Client information page would display the main information tab of name and birthday. There would be other tabs such as Notes and Deadlines. The Notes tab would just contain a text field to enter new notes, and would contain previous entries, similar to a blog. The Deadlines tab would have a to do like feature to add goals or action items to complete by a certain date, with an option to mark each item as complete and take it off the deadlines. 
Other possible feature: a tab of last know location which would show a map and pinpoint last locations during outreach engagements since clients experience homelessness
